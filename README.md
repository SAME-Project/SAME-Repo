# SAME Repo

This is a sample, well structured repo based on a combination of NBDev and Cookie Cutter Data Science.

The idea is that if a developer uses this repo as a template:
- They have clear structure in which to put things
- They can begin by simply opening a Jupyter notebook
- They have pre-built actions to break the notebook down into packages
- Those packages are automatically containerized and uploaded to the registry of their choosing

We hope this is a starting point for great development everywhere!
